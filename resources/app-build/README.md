## App Builder Program

This directory is designed to be a place for developers to build applications
and services for use on the Skywire network only. Applications must be 
integrated into the mainnet application build and deploy environment
however for development and testing you can start in this directory to
get a sense of how to interact with the skywire network and its nodes.
